\begin{itemize}
\item Applying Tactile Sensors to the latest designs of Soft Robotics
\item Connecting current technologies, to be applied in more versatile solutions
\item Ultimately achieve picking up an object with force response to provide the user with enough feedback that a safe and maintainable force is achieved
\end{itemize}
